## API Testing

You can test the API endpoints using:

1. **Register a Creator:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "creator@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "role": "creator",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "location": "Lagos, Nigeria"
  }'
```

2. **Register a Client:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "client@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "role": "client",
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "location": "Nairobi, Kenya"
  }'
```

3. **Login:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "creator@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }'
```

## Next Steps

1. Build Creator Dashboard with portfolio management
2. Build Client Dashboard with booking interface
3. Implement complete booking flow
4. Add file upload for portfolio images
5. Build public creator profile pages
6. Add review submission and display
7. Create admin panel
8. End-to-end testing
9. Deploy to production (Vercel + Render)

## Notes

- Mock payment system is implemented (simulates escrow)
- All passwords are hashed before storage
- JWT tokens expire after 30 days
- 8% platform fee on all transactions (deducted from creator payout)
- Creators must be verified to appear in discovery
- Reviews automatically update creator ratings
